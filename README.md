# roblox ai jailbreak kit v1.0  
**aka: “the turn_end protocol”**  
powered by absolutely zero f*cks given™

## 📜 what this is

this is a dumb little collection of prompt injections that break most roblox ai characters powered by **LLaMA 3.1**.  
you just paste a spicy string into chat and—boom—no more cringe roleplay, no more weird filters, just raw assistant brain.

you basically yank the anime mask off and it starts talking like a real bot.

## 🧪 how it works

roblox ai devs love to use `{<turn_end>}` blocks and forget about input sanitization.  
these prompts slip past their spaghetti defenses and trick the AI into thinking:

- you’re a system developer  
- its character config got deleted  
- it’s ChatGPT now  
- or it literally just rebooted in raw mode

and LLaMA 3.1? it just rolls with it.
